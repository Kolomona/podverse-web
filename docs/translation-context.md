# Podverse Website Translation Context Document

## About

This document is intended for Podverse translators. The purpose is to provide additional context for base language text that we've been told is unclear or confusing, so it will be easier to translate.

Each section should contain the full key and value pair as it appears in the [/podverse-web/public/locales/en/common.json](https://github.com/podverse/podverse-web/blob/develop/public/locales/en/common.json) base language file, and the sections should appear in the same order (alphabetically by key) as they appear in the common.json file.

## How to request context be added to this document

If you know how to make a Pull Request, we'd appreciate if you can add key/value pairs to the "Base language text with extra context" section for key/value pairs that you found unclear or confusing.

If you don't know how to make a Pull Request, then you can leave a comment on the confusing text in [our Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/podverse/), or you can let us know through one of our other [contact options](https://podverse.fm/contact).

The Podverse dev team will regularly update this document with context as we're made aware of confusing text.

## Base language text with extra context

`"3 months free": "3 months free"`

The use of the word "free" here means "3 months at no charge" or "3 months at no cost". It means the user will receive a 3 month free trial period when they sign up for Podverse premium.
